# This file contains the master CI script. This is in charge of doing the CI testing
# against pull requests and pushed commits to the master branch.
# This also runs against several operating systems and compilers, but it doesn't do
# other major versions. This is mainly because installing additional compilers
# would end up taking more time than the build itself, and because there's relatively
# few compilers that actually supports C++17, and specifically some of the requirements
# for this project. This includes <filesystem>, but it's not just limited to that.
#
# This is very experimental, and will evolve whenever I figure out how I do shit.
# Build with confusion, <3, yaml, and that euphoria when shit finally starts
# to fucking work :D
