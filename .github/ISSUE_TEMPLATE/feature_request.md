<!--
NOTE! Before submitting a feature request, see if it exists in one of the project boards: https://github.com/LunarWatcher/Taskranger/projects

While Taskranger is still in development, the project boards will contain features planned for inclusion. This is especially important before the release of V1, because there's a lot of potential feature requests that are already planned, or that already are in development. Feature request are none the less welcome, but keep in mind that they might take a while to implement.
