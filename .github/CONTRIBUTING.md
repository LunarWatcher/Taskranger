# Contributing to Taskranger

## Code of Conduct

This project is govern by a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/LunarWatcher/Taskranger/blob/master/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you're expected to uphold this Code of Conduct.

## I have a question!

For the time being, questions should be directed to [the issue tracker][1]. Use the question template to get started. Don't forget to include all relevant information. If you're having trouble with a specific feature, it's usually a good idea to try to reproduce it just from the details in your question. A Discord server may be set up in the future, but for now, use GitHub issues.

## I found the issue templates to be unclear

If any part of the issue template you used feels weird or is unclear, feel free to explain that at the end of your issue. The issue templates are a work in progress, and will be improved whenever necessary.

## I want to submit a pull request

[Pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/) are always welcome! Note that there are a couple things that must be included:

* A description of the changes. 
* If applicable: issues it fixes or works towards fixing.

Additionally, code must follow the project code style.

## Code style

**Naming conventions:**
* Variable and function names are camelCase.
* Class names and namespaces used to emulate a class-like scope must start with an upper-case letter.

[.clang-format](https://github.com/LunarWatcher/Taskranger/blob/master/.clang-format) defines general style conventions that it can fix.
